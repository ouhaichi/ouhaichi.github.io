## View of Knowledge, Learning, and Teaching

I view knowledge and learning as fundamental human needs. I believe teaching is an elevated form of learning, and quality education is a collective human responsibility. This belief has shaped my approach to fostering dynamic and reciprocal learning environments. I encourage active engagement, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. 

## Individual Future Plans for Pedagogical Work

As technology evolves, I am exploring ways for responsible integration of technology and analytics into pedagogy. My ongoing research on AI in education aims to enhance the learning experience. I am planning lectures on AI for elementary school teachers, simplifying complex concepts while gaining valuable insights as both a researcher and a teacher.

## Pedagogical Education

### Third Cycle Course in Supporting the Learning of Others
I have completed a Third Cycle Course in "Supporting the Learning of Others," at Malmö Univeristy enhancing my pedagogical skills for higher education. This coursework has equipped me with advanced strategies for facilitating learning in diverse academic settings.

### Mentorship Program and Collaborative Learning
Participating in a mentorship program, I engaged with two senior lecturers, (Mats Syde)[https://mau.se/en/persons/mats.syde/] and (Fisseha Mekuria)[https://mau.se/en/persons/fisseha.mekuria/], fostering collaborative learning and knowledge exchange. Regular meetings focused on course preparation, effective lecture delivery, and overall pedagogical insights. Monthly gatherings with fellow mentors and mentees provided a platform for shared experiences and reflective discussions, enriching my understanding of effective teaching methodologies.

### Inspera Education
Completed the education for Inspera, Malmö University's official tool for digital examination and grading (used by multiple universities in Sweden).

## Pedagogical Experience

My teaching experience spans diverse subjects, including Operating Systems, Programming, UX, Databases, and Software Development. I have supervised Bachelor theses, organized language practice sessions, and instructed fitness groups. I prioritize adaptability and inclusivity, catering to different learning styles and supporting holistic student development. My experience in various settings has equipped me with the skills to effectively communicate and engage learners in different environments.
