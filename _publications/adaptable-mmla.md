This paper explores the integration of MBOX, a Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) system focused on physical learning spaces, with SCARLETT, a Smart Learning Environment (SLE) designed to support learning across various spaces and systems. By combining data from MBOX, which captures human behavior and social interactions in physical contexts, with digital learning environment data from SCARLETT, the study aims to create a more holistic system. This integration will enable the generation of comprehensive learning analytics, allowing for personalized feedback and tailored learning resources. The paper presents a learning scenario to illustrate how these analytics can be utilized by the SLE to provide targeted support and interventions, ultimately enhancing the learning experience.
