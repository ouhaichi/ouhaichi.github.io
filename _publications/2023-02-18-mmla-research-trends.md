This study explores the evolving field of Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA), focusing on how research is conducted to enhance and evaluate learning systems. MMLA involves analyzing diverse signals, such as video and audio, to capture and understand learning activities in environments where digital traces are not always available. By conducting a systematic mapping study, we identified key research types, methodologies, and trending themes within MMLA. Our findings highlight an increasing interest in MMLA technologies, with most research centered around solutions and evaluation-based methods. We also identified 14 topics across four major themes—learning context, learning process, systems and modality, and technologies—that are crucial to the advancement of MMLA.
