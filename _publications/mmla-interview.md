Examining key design considerations for Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) systems, which integrate diverse data to provide real-time insights into student learning. Given the lack of established guidelines for MMLA design, the research employs a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with MMLA researchers. Through deductive and thematic analysis, the study identifies critical design factors, such as technology integration, constraints, and learning scenarios, revealing intersections between these considerations. The findings led to the development of the MMLA Design Framework (MDF), a structured approach to guide the design and development of MMLA systems. This framework offers practical insights for researchers and practitioners, addressing the gaps in conventional MMLA design practices and supporting more effective educational applications.
