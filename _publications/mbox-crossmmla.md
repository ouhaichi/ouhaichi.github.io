This study introduces MBOX, an IoT-based system designed to overcome the challenges of implementing Multimodal Learning Analytics in collaborative problem-solving contexts. MBOX addresses the limitations of current technologies by providing a scalable solution for collecting and processing multimodal data from small group learning activities in real-world settings. The system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing adaptation to various learning environments and enabling efficient scaling of computational resources. MBOX represents a significant step forward in supporting collaborative learning through advanced MMLA technologies.
