Investigating the integration of Multimodal Learning Analytics in the (Glocal Classroom)[https://glocalclassroom.wordpress.com/] (GC), using the MMLA Model for Design and Analysis (MAMDA) to propose a conceptual model that enhances learning experiences and informs course design. Through a case study approach, guided by the six phases of MAMDA, we leverage the GC's existing infrastructure to develop an MMLA system. Our research builds on previous studies in MMLA research and system design, aiming to comprehensively understand the learning experience, identify issues, and guide improvement strategies. The study also addresses challenges related to privacy and ethics, ultimately aiming to facilitate responsible and effective implementation of MMLA systems in educational settings.
