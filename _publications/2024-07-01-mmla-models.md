Through a review of studies published over the past decade, we identified a wide range of MMLA design models, varying in scope, detail, and development processes. Our analysis highlights the diversity of these models, some focusing on specific learning activities while others offer comprehensive guidance for MMLA system design. Key design considerations, such as data privacy, learner agency, and inclusive environments, were emphasized in several models. The review suggests that the aggregation of existing models holds promise for developing a more comprehensive design approach, as different models cover distinct aspects with some overlaps. We also discuss recurring themes influencing MMLA design, including usability, scalability, and ethical considerations. The findings provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and educators aiming to leverage MMLA for enhanced learning outcomes.
