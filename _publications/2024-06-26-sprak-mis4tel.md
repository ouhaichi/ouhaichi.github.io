This study investigates the application of Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) in language practice, specifically within the authentic and dynamic environment of language caf√© settings. The MMLA Model for Design and Analysis (MAMDA), a design science approach, is utilized to systematically explore the requirements for designing the MMLA system. We identify and map three elements: 1) Learning indicators, referring to spoken language learning signs, such as tone, amount and frequency of speech, and pronunciation. 2) Respective modalities and sensors, referring to the format of data to be collected and 3) Analytics models, including NLP models, that can be employed to identify and process the modalities. We propose a conceptual system that utilizes AI voice assistant while simultaneously collecting audio data for MMLA to enhance language learning experiences. The system is meant for providing insights into learning patterns, participant engagement, and the overall effectiveness of language practice strategies. While presenting a novel system showcasing the use of AI and data analytics in a unique educational setting, the study's central focus is to test and critically reflect on MAMDA as a framework for designing and analyzing MMLA systems.
